# Landing page

## Problem
Velora needs a live company website on its own domain, with a same-domain contact email, to apply to Anthropic's
Claude Startups program and to start collecting early users. The page must explain the product in seconds and turn
visitors (small businesses, data teams, consultants) into early-access sign-ups.
Source of truth for content: `../Velora — Product Vision v2.md` (since 2026-10-11; the retired "Strategy & Plan" was the
source up to revision 5). Since revision 7 the page follows v2: §1 vision and first wedge, §5 executive understanding,
§6 trust model, §7 AI, §10 living data products, §11 data processing, §13 packaging, §14–16 website brief. Revision 8
closes the remaining gaps: §15 hero visual and supporting line, §9 trusted data product, §13 wording on /pricing, and
§18's first user in "Who it's for".

## Scope
In: one-page site (`/`), privacy page (`/privacy`), interactive graph demo, early-access form, Open Graph image,
site config in one file, a launch check that blocks placeholder values. Revision 2 adds: a minimal 3D hero scene,
story-moment animations in three sections, Lucide icons, and shorter copy. Revision 3 adds: the petrol palette in light
and dark themes with a toggle, an interactive hero, a scroll-driven how-it-works, a richer demo, micro-interactions and
cursor effects. Revision 4 restyles it after scale.com's motion patterns (inspiration only, no code or assets copied):
a pure black-and-white palette, dark by default, Geist type, a full-bleed hero, smooth scrolling, line-by-line heading
reveals, hover zoom and a "Connects to" marquee. Revision 7 aligns the content with Product Vision v2 (hero, narrative
order, trust model, lifecycle, AI & privacy) and moves pricing to a separate `/pricing` page with plan cards, a feature
comparison table and a FAQ, in the pattern of claude.com/pricing (studied for layout only). Revision 8 adds a hero status
card and v2's supporting line, a Trusted Data Product checklist, v2-only pricing wording and First/Next audiences, and
removes the "Why not just use ChatGPT?" FAQ.

## Assumptions
- ASSUMPTION: English only.
- ASSUMPTION: no legal entity yet; the privacy page names the operator from site config ("Velora, company registration in progress") until one exists.
- ASSUMPTION: hosting on Vercel; form processor is Formspree (free tier).
- ASSUMPTION: demo data (4,812 orders, 312 unmatched, 94% confidence) is illustrative and labelled as a demo.

## Decisions and Contracts
Decided with the user in chat, 2026-10-10:
- Readiness Report: sign-up option only, **no file uploads** on the site.
- Form: POST to `NEXT_PUBLIC_WAITLIST_ENDPOINT` (Formspree); `mailto:` fallback when unset.
- About: founder **roles, no names** yet.
- Look: **light & calm**; trust colours on the graph (grey observed, amber suggested, green approved).
- Domain and email: **placeholders** (`velora.example`, `hello@velora.example`) until real ones exist.
- Pricing: **"from" prices**, labelled early-access.
- Demo on phones: **tap to accept**; dragging optional.
- **No analytics**, no cookies. Tests: Vitest + Testing Library, plus one Playwright journey.

Added for revision 2, decided with the user in chat, 2026-10-10:
- 3D hero: **chaos → clean graph**, **beside the headline, restrained**: about 40 small grey points and thin lines on the page
  background, trust colours (amber → green) as the only accents; no glow, bloom, gradients or textures. The 2D demo moves
  to its own section directly below the hero.
- Playback: **once (~4 s) when visible, then a gentle idle, plus a Replay button**; slight pointer response on desktop.
- Fallbacks: **lighter 3D on phones**; a **still image of the final graph** for reduced motion and browsers without WebGL.
- Elsewhere: **story moments only** (how-it-works steps in sequence, trust states amber → green, dashboard numbers count up).
- Libraries: **React Three Fiber + drei** for 3D, **Motion** for 2D; icons: **Lucide**, **generic icons** for systems
  (no brand logos).
- Copy: **icons plus about one third less text**.
- Workflow: built with the `web-motion-3d` skill created in ai-skills-os for this.

Added for revision 3, decided with the user in chat, 2026-10-10:
- Palette **A: Petrol** (chosen from three mocked directions in `../design-mocks/`), light and dark, all pairs WCAG AA:
  light paper #f2f5f5, surface #ffffff, ink #0f1f22, muted #4c5f63, line #d3dde0, accent #0d5f73, accent-strong #094a5a,
  on-accent #ffffff; dark paper #0b1517, surface #112024, ink #e4eef0, muted #9fb4b8, line #23383d, accent #5cc3d6,
  accent-strong #8ad6e4, on-accent #062027. Trust colours: light observed #6e7a76, suggested #b26b00 / ink #7f4d00 / soft
  #fff3dc, approved #1c7347 / soft #e3f2e9, danger #b42318; dark observed #83918c, suggested #f0a73a / ink #f6c06a / soft
  #33270f, approved #4cc38a / soft #10301f, danger #f97066.
- Dark mode: **follows the system, plus a header toggle** remembered on the device, with no flash of the wrong theme.
- Interaction: **all of hero play, scroll-driven story, richer demo, micro-interactions and cursor effects**, in a
  **quiet style**: short eased motion, no bounce or parallax layers, reduced motion respected, simpler on phones.
- Design review uses the Impeccable-derived critique, audit and polish modes merged into `frontend-design`; the external
  Impeccable package is not run (the Skill OS scanner rejected it on 2026-10-07).

Added for revision 4, decided with the user in chat, 2026-10-11 (reference: scale.com, studied for patterns only — Lenis
smooth scroll, full-bleed dark hero, line-masked heading reveals, hover zoom inside frames, quiet button hovers, an
infinite marquee; no code, copy or assets are taken from it):
- Palette **1: Pure mono** (chosen from three mocks in `../design-mocks/v2-palette-*.png`), replacing petrol:
  dark paper #000000, surface #111111, ink #ffffff, muted #a3a3a3, line #262626, accent #ffffff, accent-strong #e0e0e0,
  on-accent #000000; light paper #ffffff, surface #f5f5f5, ink #0a0a0a, muted #5c5c5c, line #e5e5e5, accent #0a0a0a,
  accent-strong #2a2a2a, on-accent #ffffff. Trust colours stay (dark observed becomes #8a8f8d, suggested-soft #2e2410,
  approved-soft #0f2a1c; the rest unchanged).
- **Dark for every first-time visitor**, regardless of the system setting; the toggle switches to light and is remembered.
- Typeface **Geist** with **Geist Mono** for labels and data (replacing IBM Plex).
- Hero: **full-bleed**, the 3D graph behind a centred headline with a legibility scrim, CTAs and "Scroll to explore".
- Effects: **smooth inertial scroll**, **line-by-line heading reveals**, **hover zoom on cards and visuals**, and an
  **infinite "Connects to" marquee of sources and destinations** with generic icons (no customer logos: there are none).

Added for revision 7, decided with the user in chat, 2026-10-11 (source: Product Vision v2):
- Hero: **v2 headline** "Understand your data before you use it." with a **wedge subhead** (spreadsheets, databases and
  APIs → see how records connect → fix gaps with Claude → publish into an ERP, cloud or warehouse). CTAs follow v2:
  "Join early access" and "See how it works".
- Structure: **follow v2 §16's narrative**, shown through the existing demo, marquee, 3D, pinned scroll story and mono
  look. The five build stages (Understand, Document & define, Build, Validate, Publish & serve) become the pinned story;
  then the demo, trust model, continuous lifecycle and AI & privacy. Kept from the current page: the "Connects to"
  marquee, the interactive demo, Who it's for + About, the FAQ and the early-access form. Removed: views, destinations
  (now inside "Publish & serve" and the marquee), the competitor comparison and the home pricing section.
- Pricing: **a separate `/pricing` page** (pattern of claude.com/pricing): v2 §13's four tiers as cards with **"Free" /
  "Early access" / "Early access" / "Contact us"** price lines and **no dollar amounts**, a **"Compare features across
  plans"** table of v2's twelve capabilities, and a **pricing FAQ**.
- The landing page still shows **all four destinations** (Odoo, files, cloud storage, cloud warehouse) with their build
  order (first release / coming soon).
- Project knowledge (glossary, decision records, product brief in the repo): **not added for now**, by the user's choice.

Added for revision 8, decided with the user in chat, 2026-10-11 (closing the gaps between the site and v2):
- Hero visual (v2 §15): **keep the 3D graph and add a status card** on it, labelled as an example, with v2 signals:
  connected sources, documentation status, contract coverage, validation status and the next recommended action. It is
  ordinary HTML (not in the canvas), so it shows with the still image, reduced motion and no WebGL too.
- Hero text (v2 §15): **v2's supporting line under the subhead**: "Profiling, documentation, contracts, transformation,
  and validation in one workspace — with Claude assistance you can switch off."
- FAQ: **"Why not just use ChatGPT?" is removed**: it came from competition notes the user kept out of v2.
- Pricing wording (v2 §12–13): taglines and price notes are **re-derived from v2's own values**; "Pricing set with early
  customers" and the audience taglines are dropped. Exact strings:
  Free / Local: "Manual profiling, a data dictionary and basic contracts" / "Limited data products";
  Pro: "Scheduled profiling, full contracts and change detection" / "Limits follow real usage";
  Team: "A shared pool of data products, with collaboration" / "Limits follow real usage";
  Enterprise: "Policy-driven profiling, advanced governance and deployment controls" / "Custom limits".
- Trusted data product (v2 §9): **a seven-point checklist in the "Publish & serve" stage**; no principles (§17) section.
- Who it's for (v2 §18): **businesses moving onto an ERP first, labelled "Starting with"; data analysts and engineers
  second, labelled "Growing into"**.

Form contract: `POST <endpoint>`, headers `Content-Type: application/json`, `Accept: application/json`, body
`{ "email": string, "segment": "business" | "data-team" | "consultant", "readinessReport": boolean, "source": "landing" }`.

## High-Level Design
Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript), Tailwind CSS 4, React Flow 12 (`@xyflow/react`) for the demo only. The page is
server-rendered; only the form, the demo, the 3D hero and the story-moment animations are client components. All brand
values come from `src/config/site.ts`. Three.js (via React Three Fiber) is loaded in its own chunk only after the page is
usable and the hero scene is visible; the server HTML always contains the still fallback.

## Low-Level Design
Decided in planning.

## Acceptance Criteria
- AC-01 (US-01): Given a visitor opens `/` at 1440×900 or 375×812, when the page loads, then the H1 "Understand your data before you use it.", the subhead and a "Join early access" button are visible without scrolling. (Revision 7: v2 headline.)
- AC-02 (US-02): Given the endpoint is set, when a visitor submits a valid email, a segment and the Readiness Report choice, then exactly one request matching the form contract is sent, the button shows "Joining…" and is disabled while pending, and on a 2xx response "You're on the list" is shown.
- AC-03 (US-02): Given an invalid or empty email, when the visitor submits, then no request is sent and an inline error linked to the field (`aria-describedby`) is shown.
- AC-04 (US-02): Given the endpoint returns a non-2xx status or the network fails, when the visitor submits, then an error message with a mailto link to the site email is shown and the entered values are kept.
- AC-05 (US-02): Given the endpoint is not set, when the visitor submits a valid form, then no network request is sent and the browser is pointed to a `mailto:` link to the site email whose body contains the email, segment and Readiness Report choice.
- AC-06 (US-03): Given the demo loads, then it shows an Orders source and a Customers source, the warning "312 orders have no matching customer", and an amber suggested link "cust_no → customer_id (94%)".
- AC-07 (US-03): Given the initial demo, when the visitor presses "Accept suggestion", then the link turns green (approved), the warning is replaced by "All 4,812 orders matched to a customer", and the Send destinations (Odoo, Files, Cloud storage, Warehouse) become enabled.
- AC-08 (US-03): Given the initial demo on a pointer device, when the visitor drags from Orders `cust_no` to Customers `customer_id`, then the same resolved state as AC-07 appears; when they connect any other pair, then a hint to try `cust_no → customer_id` is shown and the state stays unresolved.
- AC-09 (US-03): Given the demo is resolved, when the visitor presses "Reset demo", then the initial state returns.
- AC-10 (US-03): Given a keyboard-only visitor, when they Tab to the demo, then "Accept suggestion" and "Reset demo" are reachable and operable, and each state change is announced through a polite live region.
- AC-11 (US-04, US-20): Given `/`, then these sections exist in order with these ids: `connects`, `problem`, `how-it-works`, `demo`, `trust`, `lifecycle`, `ai-privacy`, `who`, `about`, `faq`, `early-access`; the header links to How it works, Pricing (`/pricing`), AI & privacy, FAQ and the early-access form. (Revision 7.)
- AC-12 (US-04, US-19): Given `/`, then it has no pricing section and no dollar amounts; pricing lives on `/pricing`, linked from the header and the footer. (Revision 7: was early-access prices on the home page.)
- AC-13 (US-04): Given the `ai-privacy` section, then it states that Claude assists by default and everything works with AI switched off, metadata-only AI mode, "local engine on request", encryption in transit and at rest, deletion on request, and that consequential AI changes need the user's review; the site never claims that data never leaves the visitor's environment. (Revision 7: was the security section.)
- AC-14 (US-04): Given the FAQ, then it includes "Does my data leave my environment?" as an expandable item that works without JavaScript, and it has no "Why not just use ChatGPT?" item. (Revision 8: the ChatGPT item is removed.)
- AC-15 (US-05): Given `/privacy`, then it lists what the form collects, the processor (Formspree), retention, how to request deletion (site email), and states there is no analytics or tracking cookies; it is linked from the footer and from the form.
- AC-16 (US-06): Given the source, then the brand name, domain, contact email and company details are defined only in `src/config/site.ts`, and no component hard-codes them.
- AC-17 (US-06): Given `site.ts` still contains a `.example` domain or email, when `npm run check:launch` runs, then it exits non-zero and names each placeholder; with real values it exits zero.
- AC-18 (US-07): Given any page, then its title and description come from site config, and `/opengraph-image` returns a 1200×630 PNG showing the headline.
- AC-19 (US-08): Given any visitor, when the server HTML for `/` arrives, then the hero (beside the headline on desktop, below it on phones) contains a still image of the clean graph with a text alternative, and no three.js code is in the server HTML or the initial page scripts.
- AC-20 (US-08): Given a desktop visitor without reduced motion and with WebGL, when the hero scene is visible, then a 3D canvas replaces the still image and points move from scattered positions into the linked graph within about 4 seconds, then idle gently; the hero stays the same size (no layout shift).
- AC-21 (US-08): Given the 3D scene has played, when the visitor presses "Replay" (a real button, reachable by keyboard), then the assembly plays again.
- AC-22 (US-08): Given `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` or a browser without WebGL, then the still image stays, no canvas mounts and no Replay button is shown.
- AC-23 (US-08): Given a phone-sized viewport (under 768 px) or a coarse pointer, then the scene uses the light tier: at most 24 points, device pixel ratio at most 1.5, and no pointer response.
- AC-24 (US-08): Given the 3D scene is running, when it scrolls out of view, then it stops rendering, and it resumes when visible again.
- AC-25 (US-09): Given motion is allowed, when the trust states and the executive-summary numbers in `how-it-works` first scroll into view, then the trust states light up in order and the numbers count up to their final values, each once; on phones the how-it-works steps also appear in sequence; with reduced motion, all of them show their final state immediately. (Revision 7: the dashboard preview is gone.)
- AC-26 (US-10): Given `/` and `/pricing`, then each problem item, how-it-works step, trust state, lifecycle dimension, audience, AI & privacy point and pricing plan shows a Lucide icon that is hidden from screen readers (`aria-hidden`); systems use generic icons, never brand logos. (Revision 7.)
- AC-27 (US-10): Given `/`, then the visible words in `problem`, `how-it-works`, `trust`, `lifecycle`, `ai-privacy`, `who`, `about` and `early-access` total at most 850. (Revision 7: new sections; was 680 over the old ones.)
- AC-28 (US-11): Given a first-time visitor (no stored choice), whatever their system setting, when `/` or `/privacy` first paints, then the dark theme is applied before any content is shown (no flash), also without JavaScript, and form controls and scrollbars follow it (`color-scheme`). (Revision 4: was "follows the system".)
- AC-29 (US-11): Given the header theme toggle (a real button whose label names the theme it switches to), when the visitor presses it, then the theme switches, the choice is remembered on that device across reloads, and the 3D hero and demo pick up the new colours.
- AC-30 (US-11): Given the colour tokens (pure mono since revision 4), then every text/background pair used on the page meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 text, 3:1 large text and UI) in both themes, and text selection, focus rings, scrollbars and link underlines are themed from the tokens.
- AC-31 (US-12): Given the 3D hero on a pointer or touch device, when the visitor drags across it, then the graph rotates with the drag (limited range) and eases back when released; page scrolling on phones still works with vertical swipes.
- AC-32 (US-12): Given the settled 3D hero, when the visitor hovers or taps a hub, then a label shows its name and record count (e.g. "Customers, 1,204 records"); when they hover or tap a record point, then a sample shows (e.g. "ACME, Inc. → matched to Acme Inc.").
- AC-33 (US-12): Given the settled 3D hero, then one hub link stays amber as "Suggested"; when the visitor clicks it, or presses the "Approve suggested link" button below the scene, then it turns green and the caption confirms it; Replay resets it.
- AC-34 (US-13, US-20): Given a desktop visitor (1024 px or wider) with motion allowed, when they scroll through `how-it-works`, then the section stays pinned while Understand, Document & define, Build, Validate and Publish & serve become active in order, each with its own illustration (executive summary; Profile → Dictionary → Contract; a fix saved as a rule; validation results; the four destinations plus v2 §9's Trusted Data Product checklist: documented meaning, explicit expectations, traceable transformation logic, passed validation checks, known provenance, stated limitations, a defined downstream purpose), and releases after the last; on smaller screens or with reduced motion, all five steps show stacked with their illustrations, without pinning. (Revision 7: five v2 stages instead of Connect, See, Send. Revision 8: the §9 checklist.)
- AC-35 (US-14): Given the demo, then it lists three issues (312 orders without a customer, a duplicate customer "Acme Inc." / "ACME, Inc.", dates in mixed formats) with a progress count; each is fixed by its own action (accept or draw the link, Merge, Convert dates), and the count updates.
- AC-36 (US-14): Given all three issues are fixed, when the visitor presses "Run dry run", then a short report animates in (records checked, issues fixed, 0 violations) and only then do the Send destinations become enabled; "Reset demo" restores every issue. (Supersedes the destination part of AC-07.)
- AC-37 (US-15): Given motion is allowed, then buttons give press feedback, links and cards give hover feedback, FAQ answers open and close with a short height transition, and a successful sign-up shows an animated check; with reduced motion all of these change instantly.
- AC-38 (US-16): Given a desktop visitor with a fine pointer and motion allowed, when the cursor moves over the settled hero graph, then nearby points ease slightly away from it and return when it leaves; there is no effect on touch devices or with reduced motion.
- AC-39 (US-17): Given `/` at 640 px or wider, then the hero spans the full width and at least the viewport height below the header, with the 3D graph (or its still image) behind a centred H1, the subhead, the "Join early access" and "See how it works" CTAs and a "Scroll to explore" link to `#connects`; text stays legible over the scene (a scrim behind the text block), and drag, hover and approve still work on desktop outside the text and buttons. Under 640 px, the text, subhead and CTAs come first and the graph sits full-width in its own block below them with its controls, then "Scroll to explore"; nothing overlaps. (Revisions 5 and 7.)
- AC-40 (US-17): Given a desktop visitor with a fine pointer and motion allowed, then scrolling (wheel and anchor links) is smooth and inertial, anchor links land below the sticky header, and keyboard scrolling still works; on touch devices or with reduced motion, native scrolling is used.
- AC-41 (US-17): Given motion is allowed, when a section heading first scrolls into view, then its lines slide up out of a mask one after another, once; headings already on screen, and all headings with reduced motion, show immediately; the heading text stays whole for screen readers and search.
- AC-42 (US-17): Given motion is allowed, when the visitor hovers a pricing plan or a lifecycle card, then its surface responds (lightens, border strengthens) within about 300 ms, easing out; with reduced motion there is no movement. (Revision 7: the view previews are gone.)
- AC-43 (US-18): Given `/`, then a "Connects to" strip after the hero scrolls an endless row of sources (Excel, CSV, Google Sheets, Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server, REST APIs) and destinations (Odoo, CSV/XLSX/Parquet, cloud storage, cloud warehouse) with generic icons; it pauses on hover or keyboard focus, duplicate items are hidden from screen readers, and with reduced motion it shows as a still, wrapped list.
- AC-44 (US-17): Given any page, then text uses Geist and data labels use Geist Mono, self-hosted (no requests to font services from the visitor's browser).
- AC-45 (US-19): Given `/pricing`, then it shows four plan cards in order — Free / Local ("Free"), Pro ("Early access"), Team ("Early access"), Enterprise ("Contact us") — each with a one-line tagline and a price note taken from v2 §13's values (the exact strings under revision 8's decisions; no "set with early customers" wording), a CTA ("Join early access" → `/#early-access`; Enterprise "Talk to us" → mailto the site email) and what it includes ("Everything in <previous plan>, plus:" from Pro on), plus a note that exact pricing and limits follow real usage; no dollar amounts appear anywhere on the site. (Revision 8: taglines and price notes from v2.)
- AC-46 (US-19): Given `/pricing`, then a "Compare features across plans" table lists v2 §13's twelve capabilities grouped as Data products, Understanding, Building, Trust & control, and Collaboration & governance, with exactly v2's values per plan (✓ shown as "Included" to screen readers, — as "Not included"); it uses table headers with scope, and on phones only the table container scrolls sideways (no page scroll).
- AC-47 (US-19): Given `/pricing`, then a FAQ includes "Why are there no prices yet?", "What is a managed data product?", "What is the free Readiness Report?" and "Can I run Velora on my own infrastructure?" as expandable items that work without JavaScript; answers follow v2 (§5, §11, §12), and the "no prices yet" answer says only that exact pricing and limits will follow real usage. (Revision 8.)
- AC-48 (US-20): Given `/`, then the `lifecycle` section shows "Changes → Impact → Rebuild → Revalidate → Republish" and the four impact dimensions (knowledge, contract, pipeline, output), and says the first form is scheduled sync with drift alerts; the `trust` section shows v2's states Observed, Inferred, Confirmed, Defined and Validated with v2's customer_id examples.
- AC-49 (US-19): Given `/pricing`, then its title is "Pricing" with the site name from config, it shares the header, footer, theme and fonts of `/`, and it has no horizontal page scroll at 320 px.
- AC-50 (US-21): Given `/` (server HTML, still image, 3D scene, reduced motion or no WebGL alike), then the hero contains a status card labelled "Example" with five rows: sources connected, documentation ("58% documented, 11 to confirm"), contract coverage ("9 of 12 rules defined"), validation ("Dry run waiting on 1 approval") and the next action ("Confirm the customer identifier"); it is HTML text readable by screen readers, not part of the canvas. From 640 px it sits over the scene without covering the H1, subhead, CTAs, Replay or the "Approve suggested link" button; under 640 px it sits directly below the graph block. (Revision 8.)
- AC-51 (US-01, US-21): Given `/`, then v2's supporting line "Profiling, documentation, contracts, transformation, and validation in one workspace — with Claude assistance you can switch off." is shown under the subhead; at 375×812 AC-01 still holds, and if the line would push "Join early access" below the fold, it moves below the CTAs on phones instead. (Revision 8.)
- AC-52 (US-04): Given the `who` section, then businesses moving onto an ERP come first, labelled "Starting with", and data analysts and engineers second, labelled "Growing into". (Revision 8.)

## Non-functional
- No horizontal scroll at 320 px width; body text contrast ≥ 4.5:1; visible focus on every interactive element.
- React Flow is loaded only by the demo (client component); the rest of the page is server-rendered.
- Revision 3 keeps the same budget: interaction code for the hero lives in the lazy 3D chunk; the theme script is inline and
  tiny; no new dependency unless a step needs it.
- 3D budget (from the `web-motion-3d` skill): the H1 remains the largest content on first paint; three.js loads in a
  separate chunk after the page is usable; desktop DPR at most 2, phones at most 1.5; animation is time-based; no
  per-frame allocations; hand-made GPU resources are disposed on unmount.
- `next build` passes; no secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` (the form endpoint is public by design).

## Verification
`npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` (Vitest), `npm run test:e2e` (Playwright journey: load → demo accept → submit form with a mocked endpoint; 3D: reduced-motion fallback, canvas mount, Replay, light tier, pause off-screen; story moments; icons; word budget), `npm run build` (3D in a separate chunk), `npm run check:launch` (expected to fail until real values are set).

## Dependencies
Formspree form (founders create it); domain + mailbox; Vercel project.

## Out of Scope
