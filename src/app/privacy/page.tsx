        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <p>When you sign up for early access, we collect only what you type into the form:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>your email address;</li>
          <li>which description fits you (growing business, data team or analyst, consultant or partner);</li>
          <li>whether you&apos;d like a free Readiness Report.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We use this only to contact you about early access and, if you asked, the Readiness Report. We don&apos;t sell it or use it for advertising.</p>

        <h2>Who processes it</h2>
        <p>
          Sign-ups are sent to Formspree, a form-processing service, which stores them and forwards them to us. If the form
          service isn&apos;t available, the form opens an email to us instead, and the details go through your own email provider.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies and tracking</h2>
        <p>This website uses no analytics and no tracking cookies.</p>

        <h2>How long we keep it</h2>
        <p>We keep your sign-up until early access ends or until you ask us to delete it, whichever comes first.</p>

        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <p>
          Email{" "}
          <a href={`mailto:${site.email}`} className="underline">
            {site.email}
          </a>{" "}
          to see, correct or delete what we hold about you. We&apos;ll confirm within 30 days.
        </p>

        <h2>Your business data</h2>
        <p>
          Don&apos;t upload or email business data through this website. If you asked for a Readiness Report, we&apos;ll agree a
          secure way to share files with you first, and explain what is processed where.
